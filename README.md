# Introduction

Evenor is a plain-text database manager tailored for people who
want full control over their data, accessibility and no vendor lock-ins.
It can be a safe haven for all your data, or an inspiration for another app.

NOTE: vendor lock-ins is the same as full control
NOTE: accessibility is overloaded with "on every platform" and "for every minority" and "easy to use".
NOTE: "safe" is overloaded with "secure", "private", "calm"

Its design is guided by these mantras:

+ **Offline-first** Clear skies, not a cloud in sight.
+ **Naïve** A child should grok its internals.
+ **Plain-text** Access the very heart of it with your favourite text editor.
+ **Omnipresent** Does it run on your device? Yes.

Check out [the FAQ][FAQ] for answers to common questions about the project.


# Features
 - Minimalist good looks inspired by modern note taking apps.
 - Search with keywords and regular expressions.
 - Create custom database schemas.
 - Synchronize data between devices.
 - Share data publicly as a website.
 - Run on MacOS, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS and Web.
